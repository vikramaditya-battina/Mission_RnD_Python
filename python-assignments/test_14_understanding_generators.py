Generators are a easy way to create your own custom iterators. They look like
functions but do a lot of heavy lifting under the covers.

There are also useful when you want to 'generate' data on demand rather than
create all data at one shot - typically in memory constrained scenarios.

You can also think of generators as resumable functions. The caller needs to keep
calling next() to keep moving the function forward and at every stop point where you
have a yield or return the function can return something new.
